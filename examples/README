In this folder we have some examples, showing how to use WanTiBEXOS code

Example 1 - Band structure calculation and Fat bands (Graphene - PBE)
Example 2 - Density of States, Spin Density of states, Localized Density of States (CrI3 - PBE+SOC)
Example 3 - Optical Properties with and without excitonic effects (MoS2 - HSE06+SOC)
Example 4 - Optical Properties with temperature effects (MoS2 - HSE06+SOC)
Example 5 - Exciton Band Structure (MoS2 - HSE06+SOC)
Example 6 - Exciton Wave-Function and Exciton Lifetime (MoS2 - HSE06+SOC)
Example 7 - Berry Curvature  (MoS2 - HSE06+SOC)
Example 8 - Power Conversion Efficiency (GaAs - PBE)
